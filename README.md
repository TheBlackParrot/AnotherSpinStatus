# AnotherSpinStatus
**Mod for Spin Rhythm XD that provides a WebSocket interface for live game events, similar to [SpinStatus](https://github.com/TakingFire/SpinStatus).**

I didn't need everything SpinStatus provides, but I also needed things SpinStatus did not provide, so I just made my own. I'd recommend using one or the other, but not both. (You can, but like... why)

## Dependencies
- SpinCore
- websocket-sharp (included)
